barnettit began as a way to reinforce the core rails concepts that I learned at Launch Academy. From humble beginnings, the app took me beyond reinforcement and has helped me learn some of the more interesting ways that objects can interact including polymorphic associations in ActiveRecord. I'm proud to say that barnettit now posts the content you want from all corners of the internet based on which feeds you subscribe to.
